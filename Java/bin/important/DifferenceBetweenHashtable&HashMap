1. Hashmap is for non threading applications as it is non synchronized & not thread safe.
2. Hashmap allows one null key and any number of null values, while Hashtable do not allow 
   null keys and null values in the HashTable object
3. Hashmaps use iterator to iterate while Hashtable use enumerator to iterate.


Synchronized means only one thread can modify a hash table at one point of time. 
Basically, it means that any thread before performing an update on a hashtable will 
have to acquire a lock on the object while others will wait for lock to be released.
